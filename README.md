<p align="justify">
This paper presents an experience report on teaching code smells and
code refactoring in a software maintenance class. We analyzed the following
points: (i) perception of the quality of refactorings, (ii) difficulties and chal-
lenges faced in the activity of refactoring code smells, (iii) skills and benefits
acquired through practice, and (iv) refactoring techniques most used for refac-
toring code smells. Our findings point out the benefits of teaching code smell
refactoring and a methodology for teaching these concepts in practice.
